# Task maintainence project in Angular 12

# 1. Since there are no API calls, I have used the concept of Subject to store and show newly created tasks on screen.
# 2. Created Subject in the service file.
# 3. All the required logic has been implemented inside the "task" component.
# 4. To show all the tasks created, I am pushing each Subject instance value into an array.
# 5. Upon clicking "Done" button in each row, that particular row gets disabled.
# 6. To run this project in local, please download and unrar the .rar file. Run "npm i" and then "ng serve" in cmd.
