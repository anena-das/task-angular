# task-angular

# Since there are no API calls, I have used the concept of Subject to store and show newly created tasks on screen.
# Created Subject in the service file.
# All the required logic has been implemented inside the "task" component.
# To show all the tasks created, I am pushing each Subject instance value into an array.
# Upon clicking "Done" button in each row, that particular row gets disabled.
